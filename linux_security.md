1. Applying security patches and updates regularly to address known vulnerabilities.
2. Using a firewall to restrict incoming and outgoing network traffic.
3. Configuring the system to use secure protocols and encryption for remote access and file transfer.
4. Implementing strong authentication and access controls for users and processes.
5. Enabling and configuring built-in security features such as SELinux or AppArmor.
